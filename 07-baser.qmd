## Class Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
fitness_df <- read_csv(here("data/higham_fitness_notclean.csv"))
fitness_df

fitness_df |> filter(weekday %in% c(3, 4, 5))
## equivalent to
fitness_df |> filter(weekday == 3 | weekday == 4 | weekday == 5)

weekend_vec <- c(1, 7)
weekday_vec <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
fitness_df |>
  mutate(weekend_ind = if_else(weekday %in% weekend_vec,
                               true = "weekend",
                               false = "not weekend")) |>
  relocate(weekend_ind)
```

Class Exercise 2.

```{r}
set.seed(15125141)
toy_df <- tibble(xvar = rnorm(100, 3, 4),
                 yvar = rnorm(100, -5, 10),
                 group1 = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), size = 100, replace = TRUE),
                 group2 = sample(c("Place1", "Place2", "Place3"), size = 100,
                                 replace = TRUE))
toy_df

toy_df |> group_by(group1) |>
  summarise(n_count = n()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = group1, values_from = n_count)

toy_df |> group_by(group1, group2) |>
  summarise(n_count = n()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = group2, values_from = n_count)
